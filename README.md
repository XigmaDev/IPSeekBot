# Telegram DNS Resolver Bot

A simple Telegram bot written in Go that allows users to resolve domain names using different DNS resolvers. It supports commands for looking up domain names, listing available DNS resolvers, and performing DNS lookups with specific resolvers. The bot also includes a feature for IP address lookup (`/lookup`).

## Features
- Lookup domain IP addresses using different DNS resolvers.
- Support for multiple resolvers like Google, Cloudflare, Quad9, OpenDNS, and others.
- Inline query support for quick DNS lookups directly in Telegram chats.
- `/resolver` command to list available resolvers.
- `/lookup` command to look up domain names.
- `/dig` command for IP address lookups.
- Supports `/start` and `/help` for user guidance.
